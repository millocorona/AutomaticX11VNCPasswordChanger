Automatic X11VNC Password Changer

This is an Expect script to change automatically the x11vnc password and store it in plain text in .vnc/autovncpass

This can be useful if for example you combine it with a systemd daemon to change your x11vnc password in every boot, if you want more information of how you can archive this, I wrote a mini tutorial in the arch wiki, you can find it [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/X11vnc#Change_x11vnc_password_in_each_boot)
